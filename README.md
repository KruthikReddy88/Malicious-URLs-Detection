# 🔐 Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based system for detecting **malicious URLs** such as phishing, malware, and defacement attempts. It uses a combination of URL-based feature engineering and powerful classifiers like Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost to make accurate predictions.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ WordCloud visualization of malicious domains
- ✅ Feature engineering based on URL patterns and structure
- ✅ Supports classification into:
  - **Benign**
  - **Defacement**
  - **Phishing**
  - **Malware**
- ✅ High accuracy on benchmark dataset
- ✅ Live URL prediction via user input
- ✅ Lightweight and fast

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **LightGBM Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `malicious_phish.csv`, which includes labeled URLs classified into:
- `benign`
- `defacement`
- `phishing`
- `malware`

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malicious-url-detector.git
cd malicious-url-detector
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Required packages include:**

```txt
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
lightgbm
wordcloud
tld
googlesearch-python
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Run the Jupyter notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook malicious-tfidf-ml-feat-engg.ipynb
```

### 2. OR run the prediction script (if modularized)

```bash
python predict.py
```

### 3. Predict via User Input

Once the model is trained, enter URLs manually:

```python
Enter a URL to check (or type 'exit' to quit): www.facebook.com
Prediction: SAFE
```

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Some of the features extracted from URLs:

* Presence of IP in domain
* Abnormal structure
* Use of shortening services
* Count of `.` / `@` / `https` / `%` / etc.
* Domain and path length
* Top-level domain (TLD) length
* Suspicious words

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Example metrics:

* **Accuracy**: \~97%
* **Precision & Recall**: High across all four classes
* **Confusion Matrix & Feature Importance**: Visualized using seaborn

## 🧪 Example Predictions

| URL                          | Prediction |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| `www.facebook.com`           | SAFE       |
| `titaniumcorporate.co.za`    | MALWARE    |
| `phishingsite.co/fake-login` | PHISHING   |
